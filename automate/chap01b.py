Perimeter and Area Calculator
Write a program that accepts the width and length of a rectangular space 
from the user and then calculates both the perimeter and area of this 
space. For example, the output of the program could look like this:
Enter the width for the rectangle:
9
Enter the length for the rectangle:
5
Area of the rectangle:
45
Perimeter of the rectangle:
28
Here are some hints to write this program:
•	Call the print() function with a message that tells the user to enter 
the width, and then call input() to accept the width. Do the same 
for the length.
•	Store the width and length returned from input() in two separate 
variables.
•	The input() function returns strings, but we want an integer form of 
the user input, so pass the variable to the int() function and store 
what int() returns in a variable.
•	The perimeter is the sum of twice the width and twice the length. 
The area is the width multiplied by the length.
