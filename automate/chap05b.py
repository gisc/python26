'''
Zero Division Error
Take a look at your corrected version of the previous grade-average program. If you run this program and immediately enter done without entering any grades, the program crashes with a ZeroDivisionError: division by
zero error.
Use the debugger to find out why this happens. Add code to the calculate
_grade_average() function so that it returns the integer 0 when the user hasn’t
entered any grades, instead of crashing.
