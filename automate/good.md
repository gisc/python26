Does round(4.9) evaluate to the integer 5 or the float 5.0?

When asking a question, be specific. 
Something like "My program doesn't work." with no other information does not help others help you.
The comment isn't even a question! 

The key is to articulate your thoughts:
- What do I want my program to do?
- What does the program seem to be doing instead?
- Does the program partially work? If so, where does it seem to break?
- Is there an error message, and if so, what does it say?
- What other questions could I ask myself to help me figure this issue out?

Remember: The answer always ends up being "The program did that because, well, that is what the code I wrote does."

Beginners need guide rails rather than vague advice. Here are my recommendations for coming up with a software project to create:
- Choose something you’re interested in Automate a task you regularly perform, make a small game you like, or replicate an app you’ve seen elsewhere and enjoyed.
- Keep the scale small Don’t try to make a commercial application with many features. Projects always take longer than you think, so imagine the simplest version of the program you want to make.
- Come up with several ideas You’ll find it encouraging to write multiple programs and frustrating to end up with one half-finished, large program.
- Write a list of features your program won’t have Avoid the temptation to tell yourself “It’d be cool if the program did this” by committing to a set of features you’ll leave out.
- Stick to the Python standard library, third-party packages, and platforms you already know  If you find yourself saying, “Before I start coding this, I need to learn X,” you should find a different project.
